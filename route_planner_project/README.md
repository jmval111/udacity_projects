# Udacity Route Planner

### Project Description:
Route planner is the final project for the Udacity Data Structures & Algorithms Nanodegree program requirements.  It was developed using Python 3, using the A* search algorithm.  The Udacity project was completed as a Jupyter Notebook.  This version uses a hardcoded Graph of Intersections and Roads.  This can be updated easily to work with many implementations such as an object oriented approach to building the graph.

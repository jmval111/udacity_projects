# Problems vs Algorithms

### Code Files
The python modules included in this project correspond to the problem sets in the 'Show Me The Data Strucures' project in the Udacity Data Strucures and Algorithms Nanodegree:
* problem_1.py
* problem_2.py
* problem_3.py
* problem_4.py
* problem_5.ipynb
* problem_6.py
* problem_7.py

### Description:
These projects were developed in Python 3.  Problems include various coding problem sets which are routinely solved using basic sorting, searching algorithms, and data structures such as Binary Trees and Tries.  Markdown files (*.md) are included to provide a description of the reasoning behind algorithm selection and Space/Time complexity of the code.


### Running:
These are simple Python modules, and each project can be run individually from a Python REPL, command line or a Python enabled IDE.

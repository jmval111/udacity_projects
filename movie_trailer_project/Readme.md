# Movie Trailer Website

### Modules:
Modules included in this project are:
* entertainment_center.py
* media.py
* fresh_tomatoes.py
* fresh_tomatoes.html

### Description:
This project was developed in Python. The outcome is a single page website that
shows six of my favorite moves.  When a vistor clicks on a movie poster image, 
a browser window opens and plays a trailer for the movie.

# Tree Catalog
Welcome to the github page for the Tree Catalog application.  This is a simple web application that demonstrates the power of Flask and it's associated libraries.  This application was created for learning purposes as a requirment for the Full Stack Nanodegree course at Udacity.

## Requirements
The Tree Catalog Application was created using the most recent version of the libraries listed below.  These components should be installed on your system prior to running the web application.
* Python 3.x
* flask
* flask_bootstrap4
* flask_wtf
* sqlalchemy
* oauth2client
* httplib
* json
* requests

## Installation and Flask Startup
Depending on your preferences, you may choose to install all of the required components using a Virtual Environment as described by [this article](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/).  I have found that this makes it easier to keep all the required packages organized.

Once the required dependencies are installed on your machine, you are ready to run the web application using Flask.  The following steps will help you duplicate the code on your machine.

1.  Download and unzip (or clone) the contents of this repository using Github or Git commands.
2.  Navigate to the root directory ('item_catalog') where the copy is located using your Terminal or command shell.
3.  Run the Flask server by typing the following into the Terminal (shell) window.
```$ python main.py
```
This will start the Flask Application running in the background.
